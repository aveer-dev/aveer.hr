Employee v0.2.0 is now live! ðŸŽ‰

The goal for the employee platform in Aveer is beyond just a platform for companies to manage their employees, or for employees to manage their
own information with a company; the goal is for it to be more of a productivity platform, enabling a perfect place where real personal life
and work life context is balanced automatically and privately (company can't request or see personal information).

This is the first step in that direction, and we're excited to see where it goes.

### New home page

We believe the home page should be a place where you have a quick overview of what is going on in your company, and we've updated the layout to enable just that.
You can now see your upcoming company events and not just calendar days, managers can now review all things pending their approval, jump straight into
documents you've created or ones that were shared with you, and your leave summary.

### New navigation bar

Based on your valuable feedback, we've given the navigation bar a serious glow-up. It's now incredibly straightforward, putting every page you need just a
few keywords away. And yes, we even added a subtly satisfying animation to keep things interesting.

To make your life even easier, we've introduced navigation shortcuts for lightning-fast access to frequently used pages, including messages and settings.

### Pages now look more like Aveer.hr

You'll also notice that all pages now boast a more cohesive and modern design, aligning with the open and spacious aesthetic of Aveer.hr. We believe
your digital workspace should be as inviting as your favorite coffee shop (minus the barista, unfortunately).

These exciting updates are live now! We can't wait to hear your thoughts. Feel free to send your feedback to emmanuel@aveer.hr.
